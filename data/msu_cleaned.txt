Message
Through the years the Mindanao State University has survived,
thrived and flourish amidst the enormous challenges of her time. She has been
steadfastly strong and resilient even in the face of her darkest history- the terror
inspired by the Marawi Siege. Instead of sulking in the shadow of this horrifying
reality, she rather rose to the occasion, inspired hope to the people and helped
rekindle vitality in the region.
MSU breathes and lives for the realization of her unbounded mandate as a national formulation for
peace and development in the MINSUPALA. Her stout resolution lies in the vision and missions inscribed in her
creation as an inimitable institution. Hence, this Student Handbook shall not only serve as a repository of
pertinent guidelines, rules and policies governing the academic life of every student of this University, but also
as a chronicle of our dear MSU over the years. It is hoped that beyond the prints and the texts etched on its
pages, the students shall imbibe the spirit, essence and values that the Mindanao State University has been
stalwartly and proudly fighting for.
My commendation to the inestimable efforts and dedication of the good men and women of the
Division of Student Affairs for this handbook.
Vivat crescat floreat.

This student handbook is a clear manifestation that the Division of
Student Affairs has gradually reached its goal to create a well-informed
studentry of the University. The contemporary world is characterized by
various perspectives, beliefs, opinions, methods, and even truths competing
each other. A handbook described a reservoir of information is but necessary
to guide searchers of wisdom in choosing better perspective to clearly
understand their state of affairs, to formulate better opinions and to give acceptable moral judgements
Armed with this handbook made available to us particularly to our students through the collective
effort of DSA staff headed by Director Labimombao Macabando, I am confident to say that our students are
now in the proper direction towards making responsible choices in the academe. They should bring sense of
responsibility to their homes and to their local communities. In doing this, they would enjoy peaceful co-
existence with others as a direct effect of responsible choices.
I commend DSA for having been exemplary of responsible choices. This handbook by being a product
of such choice is one wisest move you did.
Kudos!

Tinanglawa’t pinalad

to Quality Higher Education (or the Free Tuition Law). All MSU officially enrolled full-time undergraduate
students in the University are no longer required to pay the tuition and other miscellaneous fees.
However, repeat subjects will still be paid in accordance with the approved policy of P100.00 per unit.
The College of Law and Graduate students are not covered by the Free Tuition Law (RA 10931) and
collects tuition and other necessary school fees that are consistent with the approved policies. The
following financial obligations should be carefully noted and taken into account in the budget expenses for
the semester or academic year during which they are done, to wit:

IV. Computation of Grade for Maintenance and Gaining of Scholarship and Study Grant
The computation of Grade Maintenance shall be by Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA).
a. The maintenance grade requirement shall not be imposed during the first semester to provide for
the adjustment of students in college.
b. Full and Partial scholarships can be gained within the first two (2) semesters of study in the
University. Gaining of Scholarships is computed at 1.75 CGPA or better.
Grading System for all Degree or Professional Courses
The academic performance of students shall be graded at the end semester in accordance with the
following system:
A. Grading System for All Degrees or Professional Courses
1.0
1.25 Excellent
1.5
1.75 Very Good
2.0
2.25 - Good
2.5 Satisfactory
2.75
3.0 - Passing
5.0 - Failure
INC - Incomplete
A mark of “INC” is given if a student, whose class standing throughout the semester is PASSING, fails
to appear for the final examination due to an illness or other valid reasons. If, in the opinion of the Dean, the
absence from the examination is justifiable, the student may be given consideration and be given a special set
of examination. In case the class standing is not passing and the student fails to take the final examination for
any reason, a grade of “5.0” is given. “INC” is also given for work that is of passing quality, however, some part
of which is, for good reason unfinished. The deficiency indicated by the grade of “INC” must be removed within
the prescribed time, otherwise, the grade becomes “5.0”. The period for the removal of grades of “Incomplete”
must not extend beyond an academic year from the time the grade was received. The one-year academic period
allowed for the removal shall be interpreted as extending to the semestral removing period immediately
following the one-year allowance. If a student passes an examination for the removal of an “INC”, he shall be
given a final grade of “3.00” or better. If he fails, the final grade shall be “5.00”.
Re-examination shall be permitted only for the purpose of removing grades of “INC”. A student who
has received a passing grade in a given course is not allowed re-examination for the purpose of improving his
grade.
B. Grading System for Technology Course
“E” (Excellent) - Passing
“S” (Satisfactory) - Passing
“INC” (Incomplete) - Failure until Removed
“U” Unsatisfactory - Failure
Completion of Grades
All “Incomplete (INC)” grades should be completed on or before the close of registration of the ensuing
semester.

Substitution of Subjects
Substitution of subject course may be allowed upon petition of the student concerned under the
following conditions: (1) must be recommended by the Adviser and the Head of the department concerned; (2)
must be approved by the Dean concerned. In case the action of the Dean is adverse to the recommendation of
the Adviser and the Head of the department concerned, the student may appeal to the Vice Chancellor for
Academic Affairs, whose decision shall be final; (3) must involve subjects within the same department, if
possible; if not, the subjects must carry about the same number of units as the latter.
Every petition for substitution must be based on at least one of the following: (1) when a student is
pursuing a curriculum that has been superseded by a new one and the substitution tends to bring the old
curriculum in line with the new; (2) conflict of hours between a required subject and other required subjects;
(3) when the required subject is not given.
All petitions for substitution must be submitted to the Office of the Dean concerned before 12 regular

be dropped from the class roll. If the majority of absences are excused, the student shall not be given a grade of
“5.0” but a grade of “dropped”. Time lost by late enrollment shall be considered as time lost by absence.
Prolonged leave of absence must be sought by a written petition to the Dean. The petition must state
the reason of which the leave is desired and must specify the period of the leave which must not exceed one
academic year.
For leave of absence availed of during the second half of the semester, the faculty member concerned

registration privileges curtailed or entirely withdrawn.

Such privilege can only be granted for a total period of one academic year or its equivalent. Only two (2) sick
leaves of absence can be allowed during the entire duration of the scholarship and/or grant. A third leave of
absence automatically forfeits the student from the enjoyment of the scholarship and/or grant.
