#MSU.AI

This is a pre-trained application.
It is designed to answer questions about MSU Main’s Academic Affairs, so you don’t have to read the handbook manually.
The data has already been extracted and stored in a pickle file.
The text has also been chunked for easier processing.
The information comes from the 2018 University Handbook (though it may be a bit outdated).
I will continue updating this once a newer version of the handbook is released.
